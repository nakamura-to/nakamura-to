I am working on two projects to simplify database access for JVM-based applications:

- [Komapper](https://github.com/komapper/komapper) : Kotlin ORM for JDBC and R2DBC
- [Doma](https://github.com/domaframework/doma) : DAO oriented database mapping framework for Java

I would love to get your feedback on these projects.
